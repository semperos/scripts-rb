# Ruby Scripts #

This is my personal collection of Ruby scripts for miscellaneous purposes. The contents are as follows:

```
ruby/
    lockbox.rb    # beginnings of a Dropbox replacement
    mdown.rb      # Markdown parsing using Kramdown or Redcarpet
    watching.rb   # Example Watchr script, used to parse my blog posts

batch/
    mdown.bat    # Executable wrapper around mdown.rb
```
